### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on a personal project to manage my banks accounts. This project is divided in 3 parts :
- [banks_fetch](https://github.com/davidjulien/banks_fetch) : written in Erlang, it aims at fetching accounts and transactions from any bank accounts. Current version supports only ING bank but other banks may be added later easily.
- [banks_frontend_telegram](https://github.com/davidjulien/banks_frontend_telegram) : written in Java, it provides a Telegram bot pushing notifications when new transactions have been added in database by `banks_fetch`.
- [banks-frontend-angular](https://github.com/davidjulien/banks-frontend-angular) : written in Angular, it will provide a web user interface to analyze transactions and tools to manage personal accounts.

This github account contains also [ouroboros](https://github.com/davidjulien/ouroboros). Ouroboros was a tool written in C to detect plagiarism in student reports (or any document). It is an old project. Connection to Google needs to be updated according to Google current API for running search queries.

I also contributed (lightly) to various open source projects around Erlang like [Erlang/OTP](https://github.com/erlang/otp), [Chatterbox](https://github.com/joedevivo/chatterbox), [Mochiweb XPATH](https://github.com/retnuh/mochiweb_xpath) and to the [PostgreSQL driver](https://github.com/semiocast/pgsql) developed at Semiocast.
